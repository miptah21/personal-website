# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Lockfile Mismatch** — Renamed phantom `claude-md-improver` reference in `skills-lock.json` to properly match the existing `ag-md-improver` directory.
- **Package Configuration** — Added missing `eslint` to `devDependencies` and updated `main` entry point to `src/index.ts`.
- **Project Scaffolding** — Added `src/index.ts`, `tests/index.test.ts`, and `build.ts` to ensure `bun test` and `bun run build` work out of the box.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **RTK token optimization** — Rules-based integration in AGENTS.md for [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) (Rust Token Killer). Agent detects RTK at session start and prefixes eligible shell commands for 60-90% token savings. Graceful fallback when RTK is not installed.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **AGENTS.md rewritten** — Reduced to ~200 lines via progressive disclosure. Behavioral details moved to `docs/implementation-protocol.md` and `docs/communication-style.md`
- **npm→bunx consistency** — All skills and workflows now use `bunx` exclusively
- **Workflow frontmatter** — All 10 workflows have YAML frontmatter with descriptions
- **Situational workflow triggers** — Workflows now fire based on activity patterns, not just slash commands
- **.gitignore cleanup** — Removed dead yarn/npm/pnp rules
